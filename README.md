PROJECT NAME:
  FAKE NEWS DETECTION SYSTEM USING NLP AND MACHINE LEARNING

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  In todayâ€™s digital era, fake news spreads quickly via social media and news websites, influencing public opinion and causing societal harm.
  It becomes challenging to distinguish between real and fake news due to the vast volume and velocity of content generation. 
  Manual verification is time-consuming and inefficient. Hence, there is a need for an automated system to detect fake news accurately.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
  The proposed system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to automatically classify news articles as real or fake.
  The process includes:
  Data Collection: News title and article text.
  Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming text data.
  Feature Extraction: Using TF-IDF vectorization.
  Model Training: Using models like Logistic Regression.
  Prediction: Classifying new articles based on the trained model.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
  Programming Language: Python
  Libraries: sklearn, pandas, numpy, nltk
  ML Model: Logistic Regression (can be extended to Naive Bayes, Random Forest)
  Text Processing: TF-IDF Vectorizer
  Interface (Optional): Command-line or Web UI using Flask
